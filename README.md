This Project uses an external Package to handle async requests using CoreData when handling images named PromiseKit, when you runt the app for the first time, PromiseKit will be automatically installed onto the Xcode IDE.
To use CloudKit, it is only available on the Apple Developer Program and would require a developer team for it.
